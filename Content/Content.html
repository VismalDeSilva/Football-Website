            <h1>Rules of Game</h1> <br>
            <h2>Football is a game that has a set of rules to govern the gameplay. Here are some of the basic rules of football.</h2> <br>
            <img src="c8.jpg" alt="Rules">
        <p>
             1. Objective: The objective of football is to score more points than the opposing team. Points are scored by either carrying the ball into the opposing team's end zone (touchdown) or by kicking the ball through the opposing team's goalposts (field goal). <br><br>

             2. Players: A football team has 11 players on the field at one time. Each team has an offensive team that tries to score points and a defensive team that tries to stop the opposing team from scoring. <br><br>
    
             3. Duration: A standard football game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 15 minutes. There is a halftime break after the second quarter. <br><br>
    
             4. Starting Play: The game starts with a kickoff, where one team kicks the ball to the other team to start the game. The ball is placed on a tee at the 35-yard line for college and professional football games. <br><br>
    
             5. Downs: A team has four downs (attempts) to advance the ball 10 yards. If the team fails to advance the ball 10 yards, they lose possession of the ball. <br><br>
            
             <div class="para">
                <p>
             6. Scoring: Points are scored in football by either a touchdown, a field goal, or a safety. A touchdown is worth six points, and after a touchdown, the team can either attempt a one-point conversion or a two-point conversion. A field goal is worth three points, and a safety is worth two points. <br><br>
    
             7. Penalties: There are various penalties that can be called during a football game, such as offsides, holding, and pass interference. Penalties can result in a loss of yardage or loss of possession of the ball. <br><br>
    
             8. Overtime: If the game is tied at the end of regulation, there may be an overtime period where each team gets a chance to possess the ball and score. The team with the most points at the end of the overtime period wins. <br><br>
